## Hi, I am Elliott King

I am a developer in New York City. I have experience all across the board, from Ruby/Rails and React, to some machine learning. I am currently looking for a full-stack position.

### Some side projects

[freedom](https://github.com/elliott-king/freedom-js-app): an app for nearby free events.

[creepy-tracker](https://github.com/elliott-king/creepy-tracker): A website that builds a simple fingerprint for your browser. If you are interested in browser fingerprinting, I also wrote an [introduction]({% post_url 2020-05-26-fingerprinting-i %}).

[drawful-1.5](https://github.com/elliott-king/drawful-1.5): a fun little clone of Drawful. You can play with up to six players.

[r/kanye comment analyzer](https://github.com/elliott-king/kanye_analyzer): Use natural language processing to learn who is 'wavy' - according to [reddit.com/r/kanye](reddit.com/r/kanye).

[freedom-scripts](https://github.com/elliott-king/freedom-scripts): some simple web scrapers for [freedom](https://github.com/elliott-king/freedom-js-app).
